**Compete for $10,000 MXN in total prizes and a chance to present on stage at ITAM Sports Analytics Conference.**

In this hackathon you will dive into the world of soccer analytics and explore ways to provide value to a team through data analysis. The aim is to develop a Minimum Viable Product, slideshow, video, notebook, pdf, website or any kind of data driven deliverable that successfully communicates the results of an evidence based analysis geared towards adding value (whether on or off the pitch) to a soccer organization.
